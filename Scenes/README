📁 Key Scripts Overview
RayShooter.cs
Handles shooting mechanics using raycasting. Detects hits on various enemy types and triggers corresponding game events. Provides visual feedback for missed shots using temporary indicators.

FPSInput.cs
Manages player movement using keyboard input. Integrates with Unity’s physics system to apply movement forces and ensure smooth navigation.

MouseLook.cs
Controls camera rotation based on mouse movement. Enables first-person perspective by locking and hiding the cursor, and rotating the camera and player body accordingly.

WanderingAI.cs
Implements basic AI behavior for enemies. Enemies wander randomly within the scene and can react to player actions or environmental triggers.
